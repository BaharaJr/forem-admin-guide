Alongside the /readinglist URL you will notice that a counter appears in order to display to the user the number of items in their reading list.

* **Icon** requires an SVG icon to be pasted into the text area. The icon will be displayed in a 24x24 px box. 
* **Position** provides the position or the order placement of the links in the sidebar. If you choose to not specify an order then the links will simply be ordered in a descending order by name.
