# Badges

### Overview

Badges are a great way to reward and encourage your community.

### How are badges awarded?

Most badges are awarded manually via `/admin/badge_achievements`, but we also support custom logic for rewarding badges.

Examples types of badges from DEV:

* **Contributor Badges:** the [DEV Contributor](https://dev.to/badge/dev-contributor) badge is awarded after a PR is merged into the DEV open open-source repo
* **Anniversary Badges**: the [1-year](https://dev.to/badge/one-year-club), [2-year](https://dev.to/badge/two-year-club), [3-year](https://dev.to/badge/three-year-club) badges are awarded on the anniversaries of a community member join date
* **Streak Badges:** the [4-week](https://dev.to/badge/8-week-streak), [8-week](https://dev.to/badge/8-week-streak), and [16-week](https://dev.to/badge/16-week-streak) streak badges are awarded for publishing a post in consecutive weeks
* **Top Post by Tag Badges**: various badges are awarded for the author with the most popular article in a specific tag
* **Beloved Comment**: [this badge](https://dev.to/badge/beloved-comment) is awarded automatically for any comment that reaches a certain threshold of positive reactions
