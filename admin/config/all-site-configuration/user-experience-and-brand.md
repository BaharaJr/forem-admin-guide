# User Experience and Brand

### Feed Style

* `basic` is the standard feed, where only the top post in the feed will show its cover image

### Feed strategy

* `basic` is the default and recommended feed for most forems
* `large_forem_experimental` should be reserved for large forem communities

### Default Font

Select the default font that you'd like to display on your community

### Primary Brand Color Hex

This changes the look of several buttons and elements across the forem.

### Public

Checking this box will make your Forem public to all visitors.  Registration will still be required to take actions such as commenting, reacting to content, publishing articles, etc.

Be **extremely cautious** in changing this, as it can cause substantial issues if you:

* Accidentally take a public forem back to private \(breaking links\)
* Accidentally take a private forem to public \(exposing private information\)
