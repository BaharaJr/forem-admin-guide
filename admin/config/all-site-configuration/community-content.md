# Community Content

### Community Name

Name of community \(i.e. DEV\). Your community name will appear in places like the code of conduct, browser tabs, terms of service, and privacy policy. 

### Community Description

This description is used in meta tags for SEO, onboarding messaging, and the site footer.

### Community Member Label

This is the word used to reference your community members. We use "developers" as our community label.

### Community Action

This is the action that describes your community. For example, DEV's action is "Coding". Ways we use it:

* Automated email signature \(i.e. Happy Coding!\)
* Denoting your experience level \(i.e. Coding Experience Level\)

### Tagline

The community tagline is displayed on sign-up modals and authentication header. For instance, our tagline is "We're a place where coders share, stay up-to-date, and grow their careers." This is different than the description, which is typically a bit longer.

### Copyright Start Year

This is displayed in the footer of the site. Your copyright start year should be used to mark the year your community started.

### Staff User

In order to update this, you'll need to create a staff account first. The staff account sends automated messages to users, such as in the /welcome thread.
