# Emails

### About

You can set different email addresses for different purposes in this area. The default email is used to send all automated emails to the community. 

Additional email address you can specify include: 

* Business Inquiries \(i.e. partners@dev.to\)
* Privacy Concerns \(i.e. privacy@dev.to\)
* Members \(i.e. members@dev.to\)
  * We recommend setting a members email for a smaller group of people within your community. For example, paying members.
