### **Community name**

Name of community \(i.e. DEV\). Your community name will appear in places like the code of conduct, terms of service, and privacy policy. 

### **Community description**

### **Community action**

This is the phrase that follows the word “Happy” in certain emails. For instance, ours is “coding” for “Happy coding.”

### **Tagline**

The community tagline is displayed on sign-up modals and is important for SEO. For instance, our tagline is "We're a place where coders share, stay up-to-date, and grow their careers." This is different than the description, which is typically a bit longer.

### **Main social image**

This is the default social image used in social networks and open graph previews when your site is linked. You can add custom social images for each post later on.

* [Example from Twitter](https://p241.p3.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/bLuR50oQ/Image%202020-08-28%20at%209.25.14%20AM.png?v=62323e8e555beabcfe54a87e7d6f319f)
* [Example from Slack](https://p241.p3.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/YEuoWQmx/Image%202020-08-28%20at%209.26.00%20AM.png?v=e31a387a5154a77ab85711b609fa92de)

Social images have a 2:1 aspect ratio, but the optimal specs are:

* Minimum size: 600 x 315
* Recommended size: 1200x630
* Aspect ratio: 1.91:1

### **Logo png**

Your logo will appear on the header, footer, and new user onboarding slides.

### **Mascot user**

Assign an ID number to your mascot. Your mascot helps moderate community content. 

You can use your mascot in instances where you want to make a moderation decision, but don’t want it coming from a human moderator. We feel it allows the recipient to deal with the feedback in a more constructive way without being defensive

### **Mascot image url**

Please provide a URL to the image of your mascot.

### **Meta keywords \(default\)**

### **Meta keywords \(article\)**

### **Meta keywords \(tag\)**

### **Suggested tags**

These are the suggested tags to follow as part of new user onboarding. Be sure to create these tags by publishing posts with these tags or manually adding them in /admin/tags.

### **Suggested users**

The default users that appear as suggested users to follow during new user onboarding will be recently-active authors and commenters. The suggested usernames you share here serve as a fall-back when there are not enough users to suggest \(such as when you first set up your Forem\).

 Each username should be comma separated \(i.e. jess, peter, ben\).
