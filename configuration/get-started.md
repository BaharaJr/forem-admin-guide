# Get Started

### **Community name**

Name of community \(i.e. DEV\). Your community name will appear in places like the code of conduct, browser tabs, terms of service, and privacy policy. 

### **Community description**

This description is used in meta tags for SEO, onboarding messaging, and the site footer.

### **Community action**

This is the action that describes your community. For example, DEV's action is "Coding". Ways we use it:

* Automated email signature \(i.e. Happy Coding!\)
* Denoting your experience level \(i.e. Coding Experience Level\)

### **Tagline**

The community tagline is displayed on sign-up modals and authentication header. For instance, our tagline is "We're a place where coders share, stay up-to-date, and grow their careers." This is different than the description, which is typically a bit longer.

### **Main social image**

This is the default social image used in social networks and open graph previews when your site is linked. You can add custom social images for each post later on.

* [Example from Twitter](https://p241.p3.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/bLuR50oQ/Image%202020-08-28%20at%209.25.14%20AM.png?v=62323e8e555beabcfe54a87e7d6f319f)
* [Example from Slack](https://p241.p3.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/YEuoWQmx/Image%202020-08-28%20at%209.26.00%20AM.png?v=e31a387a5154a77ab85711b609fa92de)

Social images have a 2:1 aspect ratio, but the optimal specs are:

* Minimum size: 600 x 315
* Recommended size: 1200x630
* Aspect ratio: 1.91:1

### **Mascot user**

Assign an ID number to your mascot. Your mascot helps moderate community content. 

You can use your mascot in instances where you want to make a moderation decision, but donâ€™t want it coming from a human moderator. We feel it allows the recipient to deal with the feedback in a more constructive way without being defensive

### **Mascot image url**

Please provide a URL to the image of your mascot.

### **Meta keywords \(default\)**

Meta keywords are a specific type of meta tag that help tell search engines what the topic of the page is. The keywords you list here will be the default meta keywords for all pages on your site.

### **Meta keywords \(article\)**

The keywords added here will apply to all articles \(posts\) on your site. Adding these keywords will override your default meta keywords.

### **Meta keywords \(tag\)**

The keywords added here will apply to all tag pages \(i.e. dev.to/t/discuss\) on your site. Adding these keywords will override your default meta keywords.

### **Suggested tags**

These are the suggested tags to follow as part of new user onboarding. Be sure to create these tags by publishing posts with these tags or manually adding them in /admin/tags.

### **Suggested users**

The default users that appear as suggested users to follow during new user onboarding will be recently-active authors and commenters. The suggested usernames you share here serve as a fall-back when there are not enough users to suggest \(such as when you first set up your Forem\).

Each username should be comma separated \(i.e. jess, peter, ben\).
