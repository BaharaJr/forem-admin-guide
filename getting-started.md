# Getting Started

### Receiving your Forem

You've likely received your Forem Cloud subdomain, which looks something like this: `forem-742342330b2c53.forem.cloud`

Upon navigating to that page, you'll have the opportunity to create the first superadmin account.

### Configuring your Forem

As a superadmin, you're able to start configuring your forem.  Most of the documentation is available [here](admin/config/).

Additionally, you may be interesting in [inviting a new user](admin/users/inviting-a-new-user.md) and [elevating their role](admin/users/user-roles.md).

### Launching your Forem

When you're ready to launch your Forem on your own domain, you'll need to add [a CNAME record](misc/cname.md).
