# Site Config

* Is there some kind of user guide that goes into the initial setup you’d expect most groups to do? There are 20-something menu items on the left-hand side, and I’m not sure how many of them I should be paying attention to right out of the gate.
  * This is great feedback, we’ll be making this much more clear
  * Most helpful during set-up:
    * Config
    * Users \(to add new permissions for team members\)
    * Pages \(if you’d like to set up new pages on the forem\)
  * Let’s discuss further on our walkthrough
* Do badges have to be awarded manually?
  * They do not have to be manual.
  * Some examples of automated badges on DEV include:
    * Longevity \(1 year, 2 year, etc. from join date\)
    * Streak badges \(for publishing consistency\)
    * Top authors by tag \(top articles in relevant tags\)
    * Great comment badge
    * Contributor badge \(for having a PR merged to /forem/forem\)
  * We’ll be releasing tools to help you configure custom badge logic in a future release; but if you have any specific needs out of the gate, please let us know and we’ll do our best to assist
